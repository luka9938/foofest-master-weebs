## Deployment git/heroku

### What is this?

In order to solve the exam assignment, you have to hook up to a server we've built.

You only need one server per group, so choose one to do it.

1. For this repository
2. Go to <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku.com</a> and sign up for a free account.
3. once you're logged in, follow these steps to connect your repository to Heroku

4. Click "Create new app"<br>

5. Choose a unique name for it and choose Europe as the region<br>
   <img src="deployment/instructions2.png" alt="Choose name and location">
6. Click "Connect to GitHub" and follow the instructions<br>

7. Link the repository (foofest) to your Heroku account<br>

8. Click "Connect"<br>
   <img src="deployment/instructions5.png" alt="Connect">
9. Activate "Automatic Deploy" and then "Deploy Branch"
10. Once it has finished, you should be able to click "Open app". That will open a rather boring page, try appending `/bands` to the URL to verify it's working
